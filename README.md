Terraform is used to create, manage, and update infrastructure resources such as physical machines, VMs, network switches, containers, and more. Almost any infrastructure type can be represented as a resource in Terraform.

This repo contains [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) code examples on AWS (Amazon Web Services).

These examples are based in the book *[Terraform: Up and Running](http://www.terraformupandrunning.com)* by [Yevgeniy Brikman](http://www.ybrikman.com).
